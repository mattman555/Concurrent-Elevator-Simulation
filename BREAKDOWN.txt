ITERATION 2:
  Everyone together - Outline of UML, Outline of State machine diagrams for both state machines
  Nick - Majority of code for Scheduler State machine, Refactored Elevator state machine to use enums
  Jay - Added more logging to the code, Testing for elevator state machine
  Matt - Majority of code for Scheduler State machine, majority of code for elevator State machine
  Kevin - Majority of UML, Outline of Scheduler State machine code, Readme
  Ambar - Outline of Scheduler State machine code
  This isn't strictly adhered to since everyone added methods and changes to other classes 



ITERATION 1:
  Everyone together - UML, Debugged final code as a group
  Nick - RequestGroup.java, Scheduler.java, RequestTest.java
  Jay - Elevator.java, SchedulerTest.java, ElevatorTest.java
  Matt - FloorSubsytem.java, Request.java, FloorSubsystemTest.java, RequestGroupTest.java, Direction.java, TestSuite.java
  Kevin - README, Sequence Diagrams
  Ambar -
